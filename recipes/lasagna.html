        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Fresh herbs</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Spices and seasonings</li>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <li>Cheese </li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
            <li>A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
            <li>You'll need a can of tomato sauce and a can of crushed tomatoes.</li>
            <li>For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
            <li>A dash of sugar balances out all of the acidity from the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
            <li>you'll need lasagna noodles! This recipe calls for uncooked noodles, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
            <li>The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
        </ol>
