        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Eggs: </b>Three eggs add moisture and help hold the batter together.</li>
            <li><b>Oil:</b> A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, lends even more moisture.</li>
            <li><b>Sugars:</b> This banana zucchini bread recipe calls for both brown and white sugars.</li>

            <li><b>Flour:</b> All-purpose flour gives the banana zucchini bread structure.</li>
            <li><b>Cinnamon:</b> Ground cinnamon lends welcome pleasant warmth.</li>
            <li><b>Leaveners:</b> Baking soda and baking powder act as leaveners, which means they help the bread rise.</li>
            <li><b>Salt:</b> A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make your bread taste salty.</li>
            <li><b>Cranberries:</b> Dried cranberries are optional but they give the bread bursts of fruity flavor.</li>
            <li><b>Walnuts:</b> Chopped walnuts are optional but they add crunch and nutty flavor.</li>
